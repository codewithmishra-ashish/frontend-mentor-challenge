## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript (for dropdown toggle functionality)

### What I learned

While working on this project, I gained a deeper understanding of responsive navigation design. Key learnings include:

- **Hover and Toggle States**: I learned how to implement hover effects for dropdown arrows using CSS and toggle dropdowns with JavaScript, ensuring independent behavior for "Features" and "Company" using specific classes.
  ```css
  .features-expandable:hover span .down-arrow {
    display: none;
  }
  .features-expandable:hover span .up-arrow {
    display: inline;
  }
